The US-elections repository is of my works only, but inspired by several online sources. Credit is given to the sources via this readme file, not in the source code to prevent clutter.
It is mostly to show what I can do, but all programs have been made for fun or to gather data for research. 

The following is analyzed in the several folders:
  Google Trends (geographic + time-dimension).
      Note: I want to add user input to make it more interactive.
  US elections (two interesting swing states)
      Predictive
